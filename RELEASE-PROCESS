gbrainy release process

Here are the steps to create a new gbrainy release:

* Send a message two weeks before the release to the gnome localization list asking translators to update gbrainy's translations

* Run src/tools/TranslationsChecker.exe and make sure that no translation strings have problems

* Run all the unit tests and verify that they pass

* Go to the sample_extensions directory and verify that the extensions are built correctly

See tests/README

* Update the file NEWS with the most rellevant changes

* Make sure that the configure.ac contains the right version number for the release

* Execute make 'make distcheck' and make sure that completes correctly

* Do a smoke test to verify that gbrainy has been built properly

* Tag the gbrainy git repository naming the tag label GBRAINY_X_Y_Z, where X and Y are the major versions and Z the revision number.

* Upload the final tar.gz to a public location

* Send a message to the gnome announce list

* Update gbrainy releases page

* Review developer's documentation http://live.gnome.org/gbrainy/Extending
